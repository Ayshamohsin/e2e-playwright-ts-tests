### Improvement 1
**Description:** The quantity column on the cart page should be editable. Allowing users to adjust product quantities directly from the cart would create a smoother experience, without needing to repeat the entire shopping process.

### Improvement 2
**Description:** The cart icon on the home page should display the number of items added. This would help users easily track their selections at a glance.

### Improvement 3
**Description:** Add an eye icon to password fields so users can view the password they are typing, reducing input mistakes.

### Improvement 4
**Description:** All mandatory fields should display a red asterisk (*) next to the label to clearly indicate that they are required.

### Improvement 5
**Description:** In the payment section, Expiration Month and Expiration Year should be provided as dropdowns with only future dates selectable. This would improve accuracy and user-friendliness.

### Feedback 
**Description:** The exercise was well-designed, offering a strong balance between UI and API automation. It encouraged clean coding practices like the Page Object Model (POM), environment management, and dynamic data creation using Faker. Biome linting enforced good code quality habits, making the assignment feel close to real-world projects. It was an excellent opportunity to practice building a structured framework from scratch.
