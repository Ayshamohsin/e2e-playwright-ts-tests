# AutomationExercise Playwright Tests

This project is a Playwright-based automation framework built to test the website [AutomationExercise](https://automationexercise.com/).

It includes both UI and API test cases. I have used TypeScript for development, Faker for generating random data, and Biome for code linting and formatting.  
The tests can run across different environments (Dev and Test), and the setup is designed to be clean, reusable, and easy to maintain.
